Connect to server using nc -nv IP_ADDRESS PORT


Spiking:

	1. test using `generic_host_tcp <host> <port> stats.spk 0 0`
	2. Watch for connection
	3. repeat on different commands using corresponding .spk file
	4. Watch for server to crash

Fuzzing:

	User overflow_fuzz.py

Offset:

	/use/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 3000

	Buffer in overflow_offset.py

	/use/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -l 3000 -q <EIP from last buffer>

	take exact offset match to overwrite EIP

Overwriting:

	Edit overflow_offset2 

	change offset variable to = "A" * <offset-match> + "B" * 4 


Discovering bad characters:

	edit and run overflow_offset3

	Look through the Hex Dump and check if anything is out of place between 01 and ff

	if 04 05 06 or any other numbers are out of place, that demonstrates bad characters. Only the first bad character in consecutive bad characters are bad

	Take out bad characters, you can take out consecutive characters as well
