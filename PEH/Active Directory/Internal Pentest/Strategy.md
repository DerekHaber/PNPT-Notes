Strategy:

	1. begin with mitm6 or responder (Best to do before work starts, or around lunch)
	2. run scans to generate traffic
	3. if scans take too long, look for websites in scope
	4. Look for default credentials on web logins such as printers, Jenkins, etc
	5. Think outside the box

Post Compromise Strategy:
	Search for quick wins (kerberoasting, secretsdump, pass the password/hash)
	Dig deep (enumeration)
	See where your account has access
	Check for old vulnerabilities
